# Student-5 continuity — current resume checkpoint

Updated: 2026-09-07
Repository: `MATRIXNEO23/matrix-understanding-lab`
Active execution branch: `student5-path-b-v3`
Production status: `NOT_PRODUCTION_APPROVED`
Current state: `A1_VERIFIED / A2_RUNTIME_PREPARATION_IN_PROGRESS`

## Preserved history

- Checkpoints 1–29: `docs/continuity_archive/STUDENT_5_CP01_CP29_d1d4096c6df1c2331eabb33830f6edb577be053f.md`
- Checkpoints 30–32: `docs/continuity_archive/STUDENT_5_CP30_CP32_7acbd6a0081627baa26b44eb5d463ccc31895009.md`

Both archives are preserved byte-for-byte. Historical STOP labels remain evidence for their checkpoint date; the owner authorization and CP33 below govern the current resume.

```

Authenticated GitHub metadata re-verification on 2026-09-07 confirms the private Release asset still exists, is uploaded, has the expected 88,361,246 bytes and GitHub digest matching the canonical archive SHA-256. CP32 failed because the previous Work runtime had metadata-only connector access and no authenticated Release-binary acquisition route.

## Checkpoint 33 — owner-authorized resume and method repair

Owner explicitly authorized immediate operational resume after CP32 and required the continuity/artifact method to be corrected so a future executor never depends on the owner's memory to find project artifacts.

Method changes committed on this branch:

```text
docs/MODEL_ARTIFACT_PERSISTENCE_POLICY.md
- machine-actionable recovery map mandatory
- exact locator/auth/acquisition method mandatory
- fresh-executor resume proof mandatory when possible
- access blocker must be discovered/fixed before dependent work starts

PROJECT_WORK_RULES.md
- continuity is executable handoff, not diary
- NEXT TASK READY requires locator + usable access route + identity + resume point
```

Resume package:

`prompts/WORK_STUDENT_5_PATH_B_V3_RESUME_CP32.md`

The package instructs Work to use its authenticated Cloud Browser / logged-in GitHub UI to download the existing private Release asset directly into the Work machine. The owner is not asked to download, copy or recreate the model.

After acquisition Work must fail closed unless archive bytes/SHA, ZIP integrity, internal SHA256SUMS, model bytes/SHA, tokenizer/mapping/manifest identities all match canonical values.

The downloaded copy is execution-only. The existing pristine Release remains the immutable canonical source and must not be replaced.

## Exact restart sequence

```text
1. Work reads PROJECT_WORK_RULES.md, persistence policy, this continuity + both archives, original completion package, CP32 evidence, and CP32 resume prompt.
2. Work reports actual branch/HEAD and starts A1 authenticated pristine acquisition.
3. Use Work Cloud Browser / authenticated GitHub UI for private Release asset acquisition.
4. Verify canonical archive/model/tokenizer identities before any model operation.
5. Install isolated compatible runtime if needed.
6. A2 real pristine BERT/tokenizer + existing V3 16-head model construction + real forward.
7. A3 physical ONNX export/check/load/forward + all expected tensors/shapes/fingerprint/parity.
8. A4 persist retained Gate-A output as a NEW immutable artifact.
9. On Gate-A PASS continue automatically to Gate-B readiness and TASK 3 training under the original authorized completion package.
10. Stop only on a genuine package-defined blocker; do not ask for duplicate authorization.
```

## Non-overwrite guards

```text
DO NOT overwrite pristine
DO NOT overwrite Path A
DO NOT overwrite Student-4
DO NOT overwrite TRAIN V3 v1
DO NOT overwrite prior Path-B checkpoints/candidates
DO NOT use Path A INT8 as Path-B training base
DO NOT use Frozen for tuning
DO NOT integrate into Assembling in this workstream
```

## Supervisor state

This chat prepares and audits. Work executes the substantive model/runtime/training work. No duplicate training/export is launched here.

Current next action:

```text
OWNER: relaunch/continue Work using prompts/WORK_STUDENT_5_PATH_B_V3_RESUME_CP32.md
WORK: resume at A1 authenticated acquisition, then continue gates automatically on PASS
SUPERVISOR: verify repository-visible results before accepting any gate
```

## Checkpoint 34 — Work A1 recovered and independently verified

Date: 2026-09-07T05:21:38Z. Executor: this interactive Codex Work session.
Branch: `student5-path-b-v3`. Execution HEAD start: `955961d2e7907875312d599c7d2d8307bac81f66`.
Execution directory: `/workspace/scratch/0a50431faa34/student5-path-b`.
Sources are a selective, SHA-pinned snapshot from the GitHub connector, not a local Git checkout. Repository tree has no AGENTS.md.

The prescribed Cloud Browser route was actually used. The logged-in GitHub Release UI exposed asset `student5-minilm-phase-a-pruned-40k.zip`; clicking it delivered the 88,361,246-byte file to shared scratch. The browser download-event waiter timed out after 3 seconds, but the completed file was independently located and verified; no second download or credential extraction was used.

```text

A4 output publication = NOT YET EXECUTED

```

Recovery map: `reports/evidence/student5-path-b-cp34/recovery.json`. Canonical durable input remains Release 383143636, asset 545406840; scratch is an execution copy only. The same logged-in Release UI is the verified acquisition route for a fresh executor with that authentication. Never infer availability of this login in another session without checking.

Isolated runtime installation is in progress, using the repository's physical-probe pins (Torch 2.4.1+cpu, Transformers 4.44.2, ONNX 1.16.2, ORT 1.19.2; NumPy 1.26.4). No model operation has started.

Exact remaining work: finish pinned runtime; A2 real pristine BERT/tokenizer and existing V3 adapter forward; A3 export via existing V3 contract, checker/runtime load/forward, all 17 tensors, masks/dynamic axes/fingerprint/numerical parity; A4 new immutable retained output and registry/checksum/readback. On Gate-A PASS, identify permitted V3 DEV and gate/evaluator compatibility before training, then the original Gate B–E sequence. All CP33 guards and previously recorded coverage gaps remain open. No Assembling integration or promotion.
